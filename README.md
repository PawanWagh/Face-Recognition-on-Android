## Welcome to Theia Project Page

Theia is the greek goddess of sight. This is an android app that can use the inbuilt camera/video stream to recognize people from a pre-enrolled list of persons using Face Recognition. The goal is to be able to run the algorithms locally on the device without accessing API/servers running on the cloud & utilize only a single photo per enrollment.

For face recognition on the devices, the following libraries have been used/integrated:

<ul> 
  <li> [OpenCV FaceRecognition](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/facerec_tutorial.html#face-recognition-with-opencv)</li>
  <li> [Facenet on Tensorflow](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) </li>
</ul>
