## Welcome to Theia Project Page

Theia is the greek goddess of sight. This project is named after this goddess, because we want to give the power of "sight" to our body-worn camera: Eagle-Gold.

The project aims to provide an end-to-end system that can help in identifying criminals from watch-lists in live streams from body-cameras worn by police/security personnel. 

For the first version, we aim to have a streamer from Eagle-Gold & Run a face-recongition module as an android app.
